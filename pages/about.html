We love magic for the creativity and individuality it has always bred and thrived on even past the discrimination. Spellboundâ€™s inception brought an era of safe procuration of magic paraphernalia. This at first seemed like the focus but, nos has evolved into helping witches abd wizards do many other things. Spellbound started as a means of obtainig something safely, but, is know the one and only stop shop for magic users."
