The buttons use the secondary color to draw attention to them since, it is a more vibrant color than the background.

-The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light color.
-The light buttons are for dark background areas.
-The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
